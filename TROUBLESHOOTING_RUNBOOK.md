# SAQEF troubleshooting & runbook

Everything that bit us during the 2026-08-07 overnight session, the root cause,
and the fix — so the same problem is a five-minute check next time instead of a
night. **Read this before any measurement session.**

## 1. Noisy-neighbor contamination from background processes (incl. this agent)

**Symptom:** `host_saturation_pct` reads much higher than expected for the same
protocol on the same box (e.g. 91.5% on one run vs 83% on the identical run an
hour earlier), and Fn's `cp_dynamic_share_pct` drifts up ~0.3–1 pp between days
with no code change.

**Root cause:** cgroup CPU-time is *wall-time-on-core*, and that is sensitive to
host contention through three second-order channels:
1. **Cache pollution** — a big background process (opencode was at ~276% CPU,
   1.1 GB RSS, 532 min CPU) evicts the platform's working set, so the control
   plane refetches data → more real CPU cycles per request → higher `cp_cpu_s`.
2. **Context switches / scheduling** — same work, more CPU-time on-core.
3. **DVFS** — powersave governor on a busier host keeps cores at lower clocks;
   a request that needs N cycles then consumes more CPU-*time*, inflating the
   share even though the cgroup counter is nominally "frequency-invariant".

**Which metrics are affected:**
- `host_saturation_pct`, `host_plausible`, latency/QoS percentiles: **directly
  corrupted** (background CPU is part of the host busy ticks).
- `cp_dynamic_share_pct`: **robust but not bit-exact** — a ratio of the
  platform's own cgroup CPU-times, so a background spinner cannot move it
  wildly (it cannot turn 12 into 25), but the second-order channels can move it
  ~0.5–1 pp.
- Energy/carbon + idle-w calibration: need a quiet box.

**Fix / protocol:**
- **Stop the agent and heavy desktop apps before any citable run.** From a bare
  bash shell (or with opencode quit), confirm `uptime` load < ~0.5 and
  `ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head` shows nothing > 5% CPU.
- Treat `host_saturation_pct` from any agent-attended session as unreliable.
- When day-over-day Fn drift is observed, run a **same-day A/B** against the old
  runner (`run_saqef.sh all`) before trusting any reference or gate verdict.

## 2. Fn share drifts day-to-day (10.46 → 11.60 → 12.27)

**Symptom:** same protocol, same box, `cp_dynamic_share_pct` rises across days.

**Root cause (verified, not cached values):** `fnserver` per-request CPU cost
measured 0.61 ms (08-05) → 0.75 ms (08-06) → 0.79 ms (08-07) while `fn_cpu_s`
stayed flat at ~56 s every day. Not result-caching (every session deploys a
fresh fnserver) and not saturation from stored results (JSON files are inert).
It is host-state + noisy-neighbor drift (see #1): fnserver does the same work
but the host around it is more contended each day.

**Fix:** the regression gate's fixed 0.5 pp tolerance is tighter than Fn's
day-to-day envelope on this box. The gate still catches refactor-scale breaks
(0%/100% success bugs, argv drift); it cannot adjudicate ~0.5 pp box noise.
Recalibrate the Fn reference with a **same-day old-runner A/B** on a quiet box
(the established 2026-08-06 procedure), never by loosening the tolerance.

## 3. Regression gate FAIL on Fn after the refactor

**Symptom:** `saqef regression` reports Fn dev 0.67 pp > 0.5 pp tolerance.

**Diagnosis:** check the per-run gate table first — if delta% ~0, CPmapped 1/1,
host_plausible true, coverage 100%, and the 5 runs are flat, the run itself is
clean and the deviation is the reference/box, not the refactor. Then run the
old-runner A/B (`SAQEF_OUT=results/fn_cpubound_crosscheck2 ... run_saqef.sh all`):
today old = 12.92 vs refactored = 12.27, same noise envelope as 2026-08-06
(11.60 vs 11.96). A refactor that changes the harness argv cannot produce this
(the tests pin byte-identical argv; the measurement is the same harness as a
subprocess).

**Fix:** recalibrate the Fn reference from the quiet-box old-runner value with
full provenance in `metrics/cpubound.json` → `regression.reference_notes`, then
re-run `saqef regression`. OpenFaaS's reference (7.67) is stable and has never
required this.

## 4. OpenWhisk 60/min throttle (the 429 wall)

**Symptom:** ~40% HTTP 429 "Too many requests" at bench speeds; verify and bench
availability silently corrupt.

**Root cause:** Apache OpenWhisk standalone default is
`limits-actions-invokes-perMinute = 60` per action. The key is enforced by
WhiskConfig from the **`whisk-config.`-prefixed dotted path**
(`whisk-config.limits.actions.invokes.perMinute`); the kebab-case keys in
`standalone.conf` under `whisk.config` are a separate, unread path. `JVM_EXTRA_ARGS`
flows through `/init` into `java`, so raise the limits via system properties
(both spellings, for safety): per-minute 1e9, concurrent 1000, trigger-fire 1e9.

**Fix:** already in `platforms/openwhisk.py` (`OW_JVM_ARGS`). Verify 300/300 →
204 after the fix.

## 5. OpenWhisk standalone's obsolete docker client

**Symptom:** the standalone JVM's embedded 2018 docker client (API 1.38) is
rejected by host dockerd ≥ 29 → invoker can't spawn action containers.

**Root cause:** API version mismatch kills the pull/run path.

**Fix:** `deploy()` shadow-mounts a modern STATIC docker CLI at `/usr/bin/docker`
in the container (`vendor/docker`, fetched from download.docker.com; gitignored).
Stale extract-leftover directories must not satisfy the existence check.

## 6. OpenWhisk is slow → the 60 s duration cap truncates runs

**Symptom (anticipated):** OW does ~65 rps at c=4, so 10000 requests ≈ 154 s/run.
The default `--duration 60` safety cap makes the loadgen subprocess kill-switch
`deadline_s + 120 = 180 s` — margin of only ~26 s over the expected run length.

**Fix:** run OW with `--duration 300` (or larger). Runs stay count-bound
(`-n total`, exactly N requests); `--duration` is only the kill-switch + the
`wall > duration*1.1` warning threshold.

## 7. `docker stack rm openfaas` leaves the `hello` function service

**Symptom:** OpenFaaS's `hello` service (deployed outside the stack) survives
`docker stack rm openfaas`; its replicas fold into a later Fn run's `fn_cpu`
via the shared `hello` image name and silently taint the headline number.

**Root cause:** `hello` is a `docker service create`, not part of the stack.

**Fix:** always `docker service rm hello` before Fn. Enforced automatically by
the data-driven isolation guard (`--forbidden-services *` for Fn/OpenWhisk) at
the top of every bench run.

## 8. `results/verify.json` clobbering

**Symptom:** an OpenWhisk verify overwrote the tracked `results/verify.json`
working artifact.

**Root cause:** `cmd_verify` passed `--out` to `harness_argv`, but the verify
branch never emits `--outdir`, so writes went to the harness's default.

**Fix:** `cmd_verify` now pins `--outdir` explicitly, defaulting to
`results/<platform>_verify`. Cross-platform verifies can no longer collide.

## 9. Replica defaults

- `run_openfaas.sh` default was 4; protocol is 16 static replicas (GIL
  concurrency parity). Fixed → 16; set `SAQEF_REPLICAS` explicitly otherwise.
- The reviewer's "10" was Fn's *dynamic* ephemeral function-container count
  (`fn_replicas: 10,10,10,10,8`), not an OpenFaaS under-replication.

## Quiet-box runbook (final citable numbers)

From a bare bash shell, **with opencode/agent stopped and desktop apps idle**:

```bash
# sanity: box quiet
uptime                                  # load < ~0.5
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head              # nothing > 5% CPU
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'         # empty

# 1) regression gate (OF first, then Fn; calibrates nothing, uses idle_w=4.3)
python3 saqef regression

# 2) OpenWhisk full run: calibrate idle-w WITH the OW stack up, zero traffic
python3 saqef deploy --platform openwhisk
python3 saqef verify --platform openwhisk     # expect 100/100, ~5.3 ms/inv
python3 -c "import time;p='/sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:0/energy_uj';\
 e0=int(open(p).read())/1e6;time.sleep(60);e1=int(open(p).read())/1e6;\
 print('idle_w=%.3f'%((e1-e0)/60.0))"          # -> SAQEF_IDLE_W (was 5.294)
python3 saqef run --platform openwhisk --metric cpubound \
  --total 10000 --concurrency 4 --duration 300 --warmup 20 --repeat 5 \
  --idle-w 5.294 --out results/openwhisk_cpubound_baremetal
python3 saqef gates --out results/openwhisk_cpubound_baremetal
```

Gates must show: delta% ~0, CPmapped 1/1 (OW) / 6/6 (OF), coverage 100%,
`host_plausible=true`, `host_saturated=false` (else latency is not citable;
the share still is — it is contention-robust).
